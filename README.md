oronews - API week project
Our task this week was to build a simple, single-page web app. We were required to query at least two APIs and use the results to update the DOM.

We initially reviewed a few API's that took our interest. Eventually we settled on a soundcloud and giphy API, as they looked like they were simple, tried-and-tested options.

Given that it's such a relevant topic, we decided to create a web-page that would allow a user to get quickly search a song and play it with.
